  "description": "ZivaRT (Ziva Real Time) is a machine learning technology that allows a user to produce film-quality shape deformation results in real time. In particular, the software takes in a set of representative high-quality mesh shapes and poses, and trains a machine-learning model to learn how to deform and skin the mesh. ZivaRT allows for film-quality characters to be deployed in real-time applications.\n\n",

    "changelog": "### Added\n- Add a property to the ZivaRTPlayer component to control solver scheduling. Solver can be started manually \n  or based on visibility in either \"Update\" or \"LateUpdate\"\n- Add functionality to specify custom bounds for ZivaRTPlayer component \n\n### Changed\n- Ensure that target mesh is in the format expected by the \"Compute Shader\" solver\n- Shader data is now stored as a package resource instead of being serialized with ZivaRTPlayer\n- Improve \"Burst Jobs\" solver performance by using Mesh.GetVertexBuffer API to update target mesh data \n- Refactored source mesh change detection to use the custom inspector\n- Update the documentation of the \"Draw Debug Vertices\" field to better describe what it does\n- Make sure all public ZivaRT player's fields have tooltips\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix motion vectors having uninitialized values the first time a solver is run\n- Make 2022.2 the earliest version that supports the compute shader solver on Apple devices\n- Fix occasional crash and instability in AnimateExtraParametersTests\n- Fix instability in Runtime Playable Tests\n- Fix Editor errors when linked mesh is missing on imported ZivaRTPlayer component\n- Fix bounds not being calculated when using \"Compute\" solver\n- Fix target mesh not being created when the character's pivot point is outside of camera's view\n\n### Removed\n- Removed some unneeded files getting included with the package"
